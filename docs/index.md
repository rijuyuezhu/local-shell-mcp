## What it provides

`local-shell-mcp` exposes a controlled local or container workspace to ChatGPT and other MCP clients. It provides shell, persistent shell, filesystem, search, patch, git-through-shell, Playwright, audit, tokenized file-link, and remote-worker tools through a ChatGPT-compatible MCP server with OAuth support.

Use it when the AI needs to inspect a repository, run tests, edit files, operate Git, collect browser evidence, produce downloadable artifacts, or control a remote machine that can only connect outbound to the control server.

## Architecture

```text
ChatGPT / MCP client
  -> HTTPS endpoint, usually Cloudflare Tunnel, Nginx, Caddy, or another reverse proxy
  -> local-shell-mcp server
  -> controlled workspace at /workspace
  -> optional remote workers connected through outbound polling
```

The intended isolation boundary is the container or VM running the service. Do not mount host-control primitives such as the Docker socket unless the whole environment is disposable.

## Typical workflows

### Coding with ChatGPT

1. Start `local-shell-mcp` in a dedicated workspace.
2. Add the public `/mcp` endpoint to ChatGPT.
3. Ask ChatGPT to inspect the repository, run tests, patch code, commit changes, and push.
4. Review the audit log when the task involves credentials or remote systems.

### Remote HPC or accelerator host

1. Create a one-time remote worker invite.
2. Paste the generated command on the remote host.
3. Use `remote_run_shell_tool`, `remote_read_file`, `remote_push_file`, and remote Git tools from ChatGPT.
4. Revoke the worker after the task.

### Artifact generation

1. Let the AI generate a file under `/workspace`.
2. Create a tokenized file link with TTL/download limits.
3. Share the link in chat.
4. Revoke it when done.
